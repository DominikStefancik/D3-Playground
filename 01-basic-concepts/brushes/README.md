# Brushes

Dynamic line charts showing daily price development of 5 crypto currencies throughout years. Under the main chart there is a timeline chart which can be used for creating, updating and moving a brush. The brush is used to specify a time interval for which relevant data will be shown. Creating, resizing or moving the brush updates the slider values and changing the slider values changes the brush at the same time.
A tooltip is provided for more information about the value of a currency in a particlar time.

The code with supplementary comments shows how to use brushes in D3.
