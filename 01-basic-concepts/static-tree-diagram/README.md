# Static Tree Diagram

A static tree diagram showing the world's continents and countries. The nodes of the diagram represent either the whole world, a continent or a country. The colour of the links represents different part of the world (continents or the world itself). Leef nodes have the same colour as the continent they belong to. The detailed information about each node is provided as a tooltip.

The code with supplementary comments shows how to render a tree diagram with nodes and links in D3 using the hierarchy and the tree layout.
