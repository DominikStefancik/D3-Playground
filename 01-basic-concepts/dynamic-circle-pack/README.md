# Dynamic Circle Pack

A dynamic circle pack showing world population in 2020 divided into continents and countries. The nodes of the diagram rendered as circles represent either the whole world, a continent or a country. Leef nodes have the lighter colour as the continent they belong to. The detailed information about each node is provided as a tooltip.

The code with supplementary comments shows how to render a circle pack in D3 with possibility to set up transitions between different sizes for each node of the pack.
