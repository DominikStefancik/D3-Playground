# Charts as classes

Dynamic line charts showing daily price development of 5 crypto currencies throughout years. Each currency has its own separate chart.
It is possible to specify a time interval for which relevant data will be shown. A tooltip for each chart is provided for more information about the value of a currency in a particlar time.

The code with supplementary comments shows how to structure the code responsible for rendering the visualisation into classes and the code for controlling the flow into a "controller".
