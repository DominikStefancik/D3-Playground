# Node-Links Diagram with Forces

A node-links diagram showing the subway of Vienna. The nodes of the diagram represent different stops and the colour of the links represents different lines. The diagram is rendered only once, but it is possible to change the positon of the nodes by dragging them on the canvas. The detailed information about each stop is provided as a tooltip.

The code with supplementary comments shows how to render nodes connected with links in D3 with using a force simulation.
