# Dynamic scatter plot with event handlers and tooltips

A dynamic scatter plot visualising how life expectancy has been increasing over the years with GDP per capita. It is possible to pause and reset the visualisation, choose a particular continent or a year for which data should be displayed. Detail information about a particular counry is provided as a tooltip.

The code with supplementary comments shows how to use event handlers in D3, regular event handlers and tooltips with external libraries.
