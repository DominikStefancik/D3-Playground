# Continents population between 1950 and 2020

A dynamic stacked area chart visualising population of the world continents between the years 1950 and 2020. Under the main chart there is a timeline chart which can be used for creating, updating and moving a brush. The brush is used to specify a time interval for which relevant data will be shown. Creating, resizing or moving the brush updates the slider values and changing the slider values changes the brush at the same time.

The example uses simple Javascript, HTML and CSS.
